            <h1>Debunking Misconceptions about <br> being in Tech</h1>
        
        </section>
    </header>

    <main class="py-5   text-dark container mx-10">

        <section class="px-5">
        <p>There are quite a number of misconceptions about working in the Tech industry. Let’s start from the fact that people believe you have to be introverted or a geek. In actually fact this is far from the truth, the tech industry has no constraints and people from different work and academic backgrounds can work or transition into the sector.</p>
       
        <div class="mt-5">
           <p>Before we talk about the different job roles and skills, let's debunk some of the myths:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>You need to have a background in computer science or engineering in order to work in tech </li>
                <li>You need to be good with Maths, coding and large data</li>
                <li>Another misconception is that the tech industry is a ‘Male’ industry. While it is true that at the moment it is a male dominated industry there are women thriving and leading Tech companies</li>
            </li>
           </ul>
        </div>
       
        <p>As of 2023, women hold 26.7% of technology jobs. The percentage of new tech industry hires that were women increased from 29.4% in 2020 to 30.9% in 2021 - 
            <span><a href="#">Reference</a></span> 
        </p>
        <div class="mt-5">
            <ul>
                <li>It is also believed that tech jobs are limited to large companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and the likes. You can actually get into tech jobs across different sectors: Civil service, food chains, Retail, lots small business enterprise (SME) etc. So don’t limit your search
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other misconceptions include – No work life balance, difficult entry level, dealing with overwhelming data among so many other myths
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-5">According to Hewett Recruitment “A new study has found that 84% of employees in the technology industry are offered flexible working, making it the best sector in the UK for flexible working”. Most companies are flexible with Work From Home (WFH), flexible hours and other incentives to encourage work life balance. This is because companies are realising, especially since Covid 19 (2020) That employees do perform efficiently when there is a good balance between work and home life.</p>

        <div class="mt-5 tech-roles">
            <p>Some of the roles in tech that you can transition into with your transferable skills</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Product Manager: A product manager is responsible for managing the development, launch, and success of a product. They work closely with the development team, stakeholders, and customers to ensure that the product meets the requirements and expectations. Their role involves market research, product strategy, and user experience design.</li>
                <li>Technical Writer: A technical writer creates documentation that explains complex technical information in a manner that is easy to understand for the intended audience. They work closely with engineers, product managers, and designers to create user manuals, help guides, and other instructional materials.</li>
           
                <li>User Experience Designer: A user experience designer is responsible for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences for digital products. They work closely with product managers, engineers, and designers to understand user needs, design user flows, and create wireframes and prototypes.</li>
                
                <li>Sales Engineer: A sales engineer is responsible for bridging the gap between the technical aspects of a product and the needs of the customer. They work closely with the sales team to understand customer requirements, demonstrate how the product works, and provide technical support during the sales process.</li>

                <li>Data Analyst: A data analyst is responsible for analysing data to provide insights that help drive business decisions. They work closely with the product team to identify key metrics, collect and analyse data, and present findings to stakeholders.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Working in tech has its own challenges, same as working in any sector. However, the industry offers a wide range of career opportunities that do not require coding skills. Whether you have a passion for product management, design, documentation, sales, or data analysis, there is a role for you in the tech industry.</p>
